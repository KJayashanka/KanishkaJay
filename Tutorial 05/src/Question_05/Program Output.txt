Question 01

Cell constructor called
TinyCell constructor called
MicroscopicCell constructor called

Question 02

The TinyCell2 constructor will call the default constructor of its parent class Cell2.
As Cell2 defines a constructor with arguments, the compiler will not synthesise a no arguments constructor for Cell2 and the compiler will report an error.

Adding the line super(5) at the indicated point will force the constructor of TinyCell2
to call the Cell2(int) constructor as opposed to the default constructor. The program
will then compile and run.
